        subtitle: Creating applications for the first time equals making mistakes for the first time, only with software this can be quite expensive. So why not run your architecture, network design proposal, data domain ideas through someone who has built and maintained allot of them?

          description: Back-ends need to interact with something consumer-facing, so front-end development is also a large part of an app. Creating pixel-perfect interfaces is not really my cup of tea, what I like to do is create functional interfaces using some sort of framework for ease, speed, and consistency.

          description: Back-ends with front-ends need to run somewhere and store some data, access some database rows, maybe have an optimized search layer, with a CiCd to automate it all. This is something I really enjoy setting up.

      about_me:
        title: "About me"
        intro1: "I'm a coder born in Capelle aan den IJssel, just under the skirt of Rotterdam (NL). At a very young age, I fell in love with computers. <br/> <br />My dad was also pretty interested in computers, taught me batch scripts in MS-DOS when I was about 9 years old, on a 286DX with the turbo always on. We were one of the first in the neighborhood with a dial-up connection, followed by the ISDN with trunk mode, followed by DSL, Cable, and finally Fiber. The possibilities of connecting these machines to each other machines were so intriguing that I started experimenting with VPNs, LAMP stacks, FTP servers at the age of 14."
        intro2: "Time to chose a direction for my future education, one of the simplest choices of my life, so I enrolled in Computer Sciences at the HRO in Rotterdam. The education was a breeze, and i did it part-time while working at a digital agency. The code monkey was born!"
        intro3: "On a personal note, I’m a proud father of 3 kids. Engaged to my beautiful wife-to-be. Festival lover, hanging out with friends, boating in the canals, and of course vacation. Work hard Play hard!"
